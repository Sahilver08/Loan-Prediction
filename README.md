â€œData Cleaning &amp; Preprocessing"
This repository contains my submission for Task : Data Cleaning & Preprocessing for Internship program. The goal of this task was to prepare the Loan Prediction dataset for machine learning by handling missing values using median and mode, encoding categorical variables, standardizing numerical features, and removing outliers using the IQR method. The notebook includes step-by-step implementation using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
